#Look at several Rails/Ruby online API sources and say which one you like best and why.

Answer:
Hands down ruby-doc.org because I personally used it for this precourse training and I have already gotten used to it. If
I were to choose others that will be http://overapi.com/ruby/. Firstly because it has other programming languages on its 
site so that we can refer to them back and forth. It has a nice layout for easy finding of the specific syntax but once clicked, 
it will go to the already familiar ruby-doc.org site.
